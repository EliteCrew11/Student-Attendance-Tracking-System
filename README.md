# Student-Attendance-Tracking-System
###The main aim of this project is to develop a design and functional prototype of Student Attendance tracking System to maintain the attendance records of the students by scanning the QR code which is displayed by the instructor. Once done with scanning the QR code it should display as present and if he didnâ€™t scan, it should display as absent.
